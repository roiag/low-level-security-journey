# Low-Level Security Journey

👋 Welcome to my journey into the world of low-level cybersecurity.

## 🎯 Purpose of this repository
This repo documents my path to mastering bug bounty hunting with a focus on low-level security, including reverse engineering, exploit development, and Linux internals.

## 🛠️ What you'll find here:
- Week-by-week progress logs
- Practical exercises and scripts
- Personal summaries and lessons learned
- Writeups for CrackMes, CTFs, and exploit challenges

## 📅 Study Plan
I'm following a structured 6-month plan, dedicating around 4 hours per week.  
It covers:  
- Linux fundamentals  
- Python scripting  
- Assembly & GDB  
- Exploit development (stack/heap overflow, format string, etc.)  
- Reverse engineering with Ghidra & IDA  
- Networking and binary bug hunting
